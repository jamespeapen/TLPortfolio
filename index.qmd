# Teaching and Learning Portfolio

This portfolio showcases work done over two semesters of Teaching and Learning
classes.

The learning outcomes of the first class were:

 - Summarize implications of scientific research on learning for students and
   instructors

 - Justify use of a teaching strategy to achieve a student learning goal 

 - Outline a pathway to mastery to support student achievement of a learning outcome 

 - Articulate your emerging personal educational philosophy 

The learning outcomes of the first class were:

 - Gain 1â€“2 distinct lesson planning and teaching experiences in a K-12 or
   higher education context.

 - Create an online module using principles of engineering learning (EL) and
   universal design for learning (UDL).

 - Compile and evaluate a teaching portfolio.

This portfolio is a completion of the third outcome. I've taken four of the
assignments and split them into two main sections.

## Teaching philosophy

These show my thoughts about teaching. In our first semester, I wrote a
teaching statement outlining my goals for student success, teaching methods,
measuring student learning, and making inclusive learning environments. I also
made a video describing by thoughts on problem solving as a student learning
goal and the pedagogical strategies that can be used to help students reach
that goal. Though these assignments I reflected on my teaching and learning
experiences, what teaching and learning meant to me, and how I would go about
teaching effectively so that students attained their learning goals.

## Lesson planning

Over the two semesters, I planned two modules and taught one. The first one was
an exercise in setting up a course description, learning outcomes, aligned
assessment and a pathway to mastery map. This helped me break down a concept
into its individual learning steps of connecting with students, providing
information, assessing them, and helping them produce a final product
demonstrating their mastery of the module. I used the principles of Engineering
Learning to design this module.

For the second module, I made a lesson plan that I taught in one of the graduate
school first year bioinformatics courses. Planning for this also involved the
engineering learning principles.
