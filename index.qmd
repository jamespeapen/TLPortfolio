# Teaching and Learning Portfolio

## Teaching philosophy

In our first semester, I wrote a teaching statement outlining my goals for
student success, teaching methods, measuring student learning, and making
inclusive learning environments. I also made a video describing by thoughts on
problem solving as a student learning goal and the pedagogical strategies that
can be used to help students reach that goal.

## Lesson planning

Over the two semesters, I planned two modules. The first one was an exercise in
setting up a course description, learning outcomes, aligned assessment and a
pathway to mastery map.

For the second module, I made a lesson plan that I taught in one of the graduate
school first year bioinformatics courses.
