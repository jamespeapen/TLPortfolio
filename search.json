The class will introduce markdown and its syntax, how rmarkdown extends on markdown, and how to write an rmarkdown documents that can generate PDF, HTML, and Word reports according to your requirements. We will learn how to include reproducible code, analysis and results.\n\n\n\nAfter this lesson, you will be able to\n\nCreate a new Rmarkdown file in RStudio and knit it to PDF, HTML, and Word documents.\nUse R and bash code chunks to run statistical analyses and generate plots\nConfigure how code chunks and plots are knit to the final output document.\n\n\n\n\nAll resources for the lesson are on the class Github repository:\nhttps://github.com/Bioinformatics-Training-VAI/2023-data-sci-bioinfo/tree/rmarkdown/session5_rmarkdown\nThere is a example.rmd which students will download for the practice parts of class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nTime\nDescription\nResources\n\n\n\n\nPre-class instructor tasks\n\nCheck with instructors on presenting the final project requirements\n\n\n\nPre-class requirements\n10 m\nVerify students have R, knitr, rmarkdown?\nexample.rmd on github\n\n\n\n40 m\nBackground reading\n\n\n\nIntroduction: problem\n15 m\nFinal project requirements:\nCourse director / Github\n\n\n\n\nDataset identification, report\n\n\n\nLecture:\n10 m\nWhat is markdown and why use it?\n\n\n\nIntroduction to markdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can it help with student projects?\n\n\n\nRecall + assessment/demo\n\nHave them run git diff on word docs to show why markdown is better for version control\n\n\n\nBuilds on git module\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n15 m\nHave them open a sample and knit it\nexample.rmd on github\n\n\n\n\nFix any errors in pairs\n\n\n\nLecture\n10 m\nKnitting to different output formats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n20 m\nUse the sample to knit to HTML, word\nexample.rmd on github\n\n\nDemo: themes\n\nand pdf, trying out different options\n\n\n\nBreak\n5 m\n\n\n\n\nFollow-along demo\n20 m\nCode and chunk options\n\n\n\nPractice and formative assessment\n15 m\nTake the iris dataset, run an ANOVA,\nexample.rmd on github\n\n\n\n\nmake plots with captions, verify that it knits.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents will submit markdown on github\n\n\n\nDemo\n\nTour of RStudio and its config options\n\n\n\n\n\nthat help with writing and editing\n\n\n\nHomework and next steps\n\nIf they haven’t finished the formative assessment, they can do it over the next week and submit to github\n\n\n\nPost-class tasks: instructor\n\nCheck in with students who had trouble to make sure they have what they need to complete the work\n\n\n\nTotal\n110 m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis lesson is part of the Data Analysis and Bioinformatics class at VAIGS. The course goal is to introduce first-year PhD students to common bioinformatic tools and teach them how to use them during in their work. Before this lesson, students would have learned how to navigate a linux filesystem and manipulate files, use git and github to share and version control files, and use R for basic data input and statistical analysis. For this lesson, students will need to remember the R code they learned in the previous two lessons. During this lesson they will learn how the analysis done with those methods can be integrated into one shareable, version controlled report that includes both their code and their analysis. Subsequent lessons will have more involved analyses that would require students to maintain reproducible reports using Rmarkdown and the course will end with them presenting their project as the output of an Rmarkdown document with properly formatted code and results.\n\n\n\nDuring this lesson, the hardest thing for students to work with would be the move from writing prose in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor to one where they have to set formatting and layout using symbols and code. There are also a lot of configuration options that may overwhelm them. As an instructor, I would need to make sure they are all on the same page, and work with any problems that might result from differences in the laptops they have or their prior skillset. I would also have to make sure they understand the configuration options they need, but also let them know that although there are a lot of options, they don’t need to know or understand all of them in this lesson. They can be confident that what they learn here can be useful to them and help them learn more.\n\n\n\nThe course instructors introduced the final project requirements - which is the summative assessment for the class. However, they did it a little differently than I expected from my time in the class and did not go into a lot of detail on the datasets required or the final presentation format. I tried to incorporate a bit of that in my introduction.\nThe introduction went well, but the first practice/test of their ability to run the code did not go smoothly since there were differences in their computer hardware and R installations that gave some trouble. It was also clear that not everyone had done the pre-class assignment fully. This did not take too long since I was able to give them alternative ways to follow along in class.\nDuring the class, some of the students showed that they had some experience with the subject and had informed questions, while others were very quiet, even when asked whether they had caught up to what I had asked them to do.\nI had an hour at the end where they were working on their formative assessment. The goal was to get them to practice working with Markdown and generate a short, but full report on a small dataset. I’m glad I had the full time, since there was a wider range of skill than I expected and this allowed me to walk around the class as they worked and help as needed. There were some students who asked for help only as I came around. The slower students were able to ask for help to complete the work, while the faster ones completed the work and had time to explore other configuration options for their reports.\nI think I could have broken down the material and added more to make it more granular - they did not know some things I thought they would. Some of it was outside my control and from the previous classes that I only knew the title of - I didn’t attend the class and see exactly what they learned and how proficient they got. It seemed like they learned some things, but did not have much time to practice them."
