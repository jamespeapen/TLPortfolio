    "text": "I believe education’s goal is to create problem solvers. Through education, we learn about the facts and ideas in our fields so that we can apply them in the world to solve problems we care about. It is important to check that students can apply what is taught in practical situations where they can see for themselves the applicability of their learning. Usually this happens when people move out of their structured learning environments to environments where they have to apply their knowledge and skills to use. I think there can be a way to bridge these situations so students can both learn and apply, having both processes complement each other.\nWith this goal in mind, I plan to use simulation to help students learn scientific problem solving in their fields. Not only does this help them practice and enhance their problem solving skills, it also helps them make their learning their own as they recognize what they need to learn to better solve problems. Learning framed this way is the acquisition of new knowledge and ideas that changes not only the way we think about the world, but also the way we go about our work in it. The field of scientific computing is particularly suited to using simulation as a means of learning because practicing and trying different problem solving approaches is the primary way to learn.\nSimulation-based learning allows students to chart their own learning and problem solving goals in class. This has the added benefit of helping them become the ‘experts’ in their ‘field’ which I find increases their confidence and engagement. In my experience solving problems with contexts bigger than just my classes and tests, helped me see that my skills were valuable and applicable beyond my classes. Looking at learning this way improved my motivation to continue learning and I hope to do the same with my students.\nFurther, using simulation as a teaching method also adds opportunities to teach and practice teamwork since most real-world jobs involve working as a team. Teams can be better for both better problem solving and inclusivity since students from different backgrounds and experiences can better their team with their particular skills and knowledge. These learning experiences can help students appreciate the variety of their own and others’ skills and experiences. There is also the added benefit of providing students with experiences that would normally only be part of an internship or job. From my experience as an international student in the US, I know that finding such opportunities can be quite difficult and depend on the law and school administrative policy. If these simulation’s equip students with skills they can take to a job, it could be argued that their lack of internship experience during their education is not a point against them. Since computing projects do not generally require specialized equipment, projects done in class and as part of summative assessments can be added to student portfolios as examples of their skills and expertise.\nStudent learning can be assessed by checking to make sure that understanding has actually transferred the way the teacher intended using exercises that test that understanding. My science education teacher tested my class every week, reinforcing our learning so frequently that I did not have to study for the final exam. Testing early and often is a strategy that reinforce what students learn in class by continuously stimulating recall. It can also help both the teacher and students catch poorly understood concepts early, before they build up and hinder learning throughout the course. Some students finds testing a particularly stressful experience. Even though they do well in class and are fulfilling learning goals, they do poorly in tests. Getting these students comfortable and confident in their knowledge of the field will help them problem solve more easily since the relevant background knowledge is well understood.\nTheir problem solving can be assessed by examining the problem they chose and whether they solved it. This can involve self and peer review since I think it is important for their assess their own abilities and practice looking at their own work to make it better as well as to see how much they’ve learned and applied knowledge and skills. Peer review provides practice in giving and receiving peer feedback respectfully and clearly.\nThrough my teaching I want to show students that they can harness the full power available to them in computing for the research want to do and the problems they want to solve. They are not restricted to the methods and solutions that others have created for them - they can make their own to solve their own unique problems."

The course goal is to introduce first-year PhD students to common bioinformatic tools and teach them how to use them during in their work. Before this lesson, students would have learned how to navigate a linux filesystem and manipulate files, use git and github to share and version control files, and use R for basic data input and statistical analysis. For this lesson, students will need to remember the R code they learned in the previous two lessons. During this lesson they will learn how the analysis done with those methods can be integrated into one shareable, version controlled report that includes both their code and their analysis. Subsequent lessons will have more involved analyses that would require students to maintain reproducible reports using Rmarkdown and the course will end with them presenting their project as the output of an Rmarkdown document with properly formatted code and results.\n\n\n\nDuring this lesson, the hardest thing for students to work with would be the move from writing prose in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor to one where they have to set formatting and layout using symbols and code. There are also a lot of configuration options that may overwhelm them. As an instructor, I would need to make sure they are all on the same page, and work with any problems that might result from differences in the laptops they have or their prior skillset. I would also have to make sure they understand the configuration options they need, but also let them know that although there are a lot of options, they don’t need to know or understand all of them in this lesson. They can be confident that what they learn here can be useful to them and help them learn more.\n\n\n\nThe course instructors introduced the final project requirements - which is the summative assessment for the class. However, they did it a little differently than I expected from my time in the class and did not go into a lot of detail on the datasets required or the final presentation format. I tried to incorporate a bit of that in my introduction.\nThe introduction went well, but the first practice/test of their ability to run the code did not go smoothly since there were differences in their computer hardware and R installations that gave some trouble. It was also clear that not everyone had done the pre-class assignment fully. This did not take too long since I was able to give them alternative ways to follow along in class.\nDuring the class, some of the students showed that they had some experience with the subject and had informed questions, while others were very quiet, even when asked whether they had caught up to what I had asked them to do.\nI had an hour at the end where they were working on their formative assessment. The goal was to get them to practice working with Markdown and generate a short, but full report on a small dataset. I’m glad I had the full time, since there was a wider range of skill than I expected and this allowed me to walk around the class as they worked and help as needed. There were some students who asked for help only as I came around. The slower students were able to ask for help to complete the work, while the faster ones completed the work and had time to explore other configuration options for their reports.\nI think I could have broken down the material and added more to make it more granular - they did not know some things I thought they would. Some of it was outside my control and from the previous classes that I only knew the title of - I didn’t attend the class and see exactly what they learned and how proficient they got. It seemed like they learned some things, but did not have much time to practice them."
