# Pathway to mastery

## Course description

Modern scientific research is driven by computing power. Using this power
effectively is key to driving good research and results. This course surveys the
scientific computing landscape and the tools available for scientists that will
help you as you solve research problems. You will learn to use basic scientific
computing tools like Linux and the python programming language to solve
scientific problems. We will also learn skills like filesystem organization,
text manipulation, and choosing data structures and algorithms that are best
suited to our research needs. You will get to practice computing skills on data
and research questions that are of interest to you – you could even bring data
from other classes that you need to analyze. Instead of tests, you will learn to
read documentation and effectively use the internet to find solutions to your
programming problems and demonstrate your mastery of the class learning goals.
After completing the course, you will have the skills to automate parts of your
research workflow, increase the efficiency with which you process and analyze
data, collaborate effectively on data driven projects and fix issues as they
arise, and write maintainable code.

## Course learning objectives


|  Key impacts                  |    Draft statements       |  CLOs   	|
| -------------                 |-------------              | -------   |
|  Concepts: Regular expressions|  Write regular expressions to capture strings of interest. Write expressions to replace strings and patterns. Patterns of interest should be scientifically relevant, students don't have to be able to capture any pattern.                         |           |
