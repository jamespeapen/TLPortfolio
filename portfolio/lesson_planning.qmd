## Lesson planning

Over the two semesters, I planned two modules. The first one was an exercise in
setting up a course description, learning outcomes, aligned assessment and a
pathway to mastery map.

For the second module, I made a lesson plan that I taught in one of the graduate
school first year bioinformatics courses.
