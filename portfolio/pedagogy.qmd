## Problem solving as a learning goal

For this assignment we were asked to pick a learning goal for our students and a
pedagogical strategy we could use to help them reach that goal. I picked problem
solving as my learning goal since the concepts I'd like to teach are methods to
solve problems and are best taught and demonstrated by solving problems. I
picked simulation as my strategy because its relatively easy to do in the
classroom and I can try to provide students with an atmosphere that they might
encounter in their future assessments and work. At the same time it remains an
opportunity to learn while getting help and guidance.

By doing this assignment I learned how to think about a learning goal, pick a
relevant strategy that helps students achieve that and justify my choice - this
was a fulfillment of one the early course learning outcomes.
